# erp-project

ERP Project
Welcome to the ERP Project built with Express.js! This project is a robust solution for managing various operations, including homework management, lessons, and more.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
PostgreSQL (or any other supported database)
Any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/erp-project.git
```

Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd erp-project
```

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create .env File

Make sure to create your own .env file in the root of the project. This file is necessary to store environment-specific variables like database connection details, API keys, etc.
Here's an example of the .env file:

```
PORT=3000
# DATABASE
PG_PASSWORD = 1111
PG_USER = postgres
PG_NAME = postgres
PG_HOST = localhost
PG_PORT = 5432
# USER EMAIL SETTINGS
USER_EMAIL= // your account
USER_APP_PASSWORD= // app password of your account
# WEB TOKENS
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET = qwerty
JWT_ACCESS_TIME = 1h
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = qwerty123
JWT_REFRESH_TIME = 3h
CLIENT_ID= //your client id from console google cloud
CLIENT_SECRET=//your client id from console google cloud
```

Replace the values with your actual environment settings.

To create all tables (Optional)

If your project involves a database, make sure the database is set up correctly. Run the migration scripts (if applicable) to create the necessary tables:

```
http://localhost:PORT/api/v1/setup
```

Run the Application

After completing the setup, you can start the server:

```
npm run dev
```

By default, the application will run on http://localhost:3000, but you can change the port in your .env file.
