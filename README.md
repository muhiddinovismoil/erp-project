ERP Project
Welcome to the ERP Project built with Express.js! This project is a robust solution for managing various operations, including homework management, lessons, and more.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
PostgreSQL (or any other supported database)
Any IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
Setup Instructions
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/erp-project.git
```

Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd erp-project
```

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Create .env File

Make sure to create your own .env file in the root of the project. This file is necessary to store environment-specific variables like database connection details, API keys, etc.
Here's an example of the .env file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=3000
```

Replace the values with your actual environment settings.

To create all tables (Optional)

If your project involves a database, make sure the database is set up correctly. Run the migration scripts (if applicable) to create the necessary tables:

```
http://localhost:PORT/api/v1/setup
```

Run the Application

After completing the setup, you can start the server:

```
npm start
```

By default, the application will run on http://localhost:3000, but you can change the port in your .env file.

Test the API

Use Postman or Insomnia to test the API endpoints. The API supports CRUD operations for entities like homeworks, lessons, and others (depending on your specific implementation).
Example POST request to create a homework:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/homeworks
{
"title": "Math Homework",
"description": "Complete exercises from page 10 to 20.",
"homework_file": "math_homework.pdf",
"status": "jarayonda",
"start_time": "2024-11-27T10:00:00.000Z",
"end_time": "2024-11-27T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```
